# Data Preprocessing:
The data preprocessing code includes various functions and snippets aimed at preparing the data for model training. This involves loading datasets, cleaning and formatting data, and augmenting images. Detailed handling of images and associated metadata ensures that the data is ready for analysis. Key tasks include extracting features from images, cropping, and organizing images into directories for further processing.

# Model Training:
The model training section features code dedicated to building and training deep learning models. This includes:

# Defining neural network architectures.
Setting training parameters such as learning rates and batch sizes.
Executing training loops with epochs and validation checks.
Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction from images.
Potentially employing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers for generating text descriptions from visual features.

# Evaluation:
The evaluation code assesses the performance of the trained models. This involves:

Generating captions for images using the trained models.
Comparing generated captions with reference captions.
Computing evaluation metrics such as BLEU scores to measure the accuracy and relevance of the generated descriptions.
Visualizing results through plots and tables, providing insights into model performance.
